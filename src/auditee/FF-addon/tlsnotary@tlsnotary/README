If you have downloaded TLSNotary from github, here is how you can create a standalone addon for Firefox:


1. Create a new dir tlsnotary@tlsnotary.

2. Copy the contents of /src/auditee/FF-addon/tlsnotary@tlsnotary/* into tlsnotary@tlsnotary.

3. Delete the /src/auditee/FF-addon/tlsnotary@tlsnotary dir.

4. Copy /src dir into tlsnotary@tlsnotary. This will create the tlsnotary@tlsnotary/src dir. 

4.1 If the addon will be used on Windows. Use the minimal set of files already prepared from https://github.com/themighty1/python-minimal. Put Python27 into tlsnotary@tlsnotary

4.2 If the addon will NOT be used on Windows (Linux/OSX-only), simply create an empty Python27 dir inside tlsnotary@tlsnotary 

5. Zip up the CONTENTS of tlsnotary@tlsnotary dir (NOT the dir itself )and change .zip extension to .xpi

6. Open the xpi file inside Firefox.
